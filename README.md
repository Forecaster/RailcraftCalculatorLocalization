RailcraftCalculatorLocalization
===============================

Railcraft Boiler calculator localization project

This is for the new boiler calculator localization system to allow people to contribute with translations, similar to the railcraft localization project.

There is a default English .lang file demonstrating the formatting.

Comment lines that begin with // are ignored by the parser along with empty lines.

The syntax for a string is id=string.

To prevent html-injection no html tags are allowed in the strings.

A substitute is used to represent predefined tags, currently only @o is used, this is replaced in the parser with the appropriate tag to color the text.
