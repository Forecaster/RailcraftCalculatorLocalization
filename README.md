RailcraftCalculatorLocalization
===============================

Railcraft Boiler calculator localization project

This is for the new boiler calculator localization system to allow people to contribute with translations, similar to the railcraft localization project.

There is a default English .lang file demonstrating the formatting.

Comment lines that begin with // are ignored by the parser along with empty lines.

The syntax for a string is id=string.

The "string" part is what you would translate.

To prevent html-injection no html tags are allowed in the strings.

Excluded are the <o> and <c> tags which is are custom tags used to apply text styles to specific strings.
